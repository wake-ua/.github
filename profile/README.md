At **Web and Knowledge (WaKe)**, we work to make the web a **smarter, more adaptive, and human-centered environment**. We investigate how **web technologies** and **knowledge management** can be integrated to create digital solutions capable of understanding and better responding to users' needs.

Since **2012**, under the direction of **Irene Garrigós Fernández**, we have developed **knowledge-based methods and tools** that enhance the design, personalization, and intelligence of web applications. Our research areas include **data mining**, **Web Intelligence**, and **semantic data integration**, aimed at transforming complex information into useful knowledge.

<!-- The **WaKe Research Group (Web and Knowledge Engineering)** focuses on advancing software engineering methods and knowledge-driven techniques for building intelligent web systems and enabling user-centered knowledge discovery. Our work integrates web technologies, data analysis, and knowledge engineering to develop innovative solutions with real impact.

## 🧩 Research Lines
### **1. Knowledge-Based Software Engineering**
We design and evaluate methods that incorporate different forms of knowledge into the development of web applications. This includes:
- Web mashups  
- Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)  
- Knowledge-driven development processes and architectures  

### **2. User-Centered Methods for Knowledge Discovery**
We develop approaches that empower users to explore, generate, and understand knowledge derived from heterogeneous structured data:
- Data mining techniques  
- Knowledge Discovery processes  
- User-centered interaction methods and interfaces
