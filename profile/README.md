## 🧩 Research Lines

### **1. Knowledge-Based Software Engineering**
We design and evaluate methods that incorporate different forms of knowledge into the development of web applications. This includes:
- Web mashups  
- Rich Internet Applications (RIAs)  
- Knowledge-driven development processes and architectures  

### **2. User-Centered Methods for Knowledge Discovery**
We develop approaches that empower users to explore, generate, and understand knowledge derived from heterogeneous structured data:
- Data mining techniques  
- Knowledge Discovery processes  
- User-centered interaction methods and interfaces
